This vision we see is Awareness Capitalism with the help of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
## Mission - the Overall Picture
#### Pain
Egotism is the root cause of suffering, which results in world wide big problems including social hatred on wealth distribution, natural resource unsustainability, and economical inefficiency.
#### Cure
Global spiritual awareness is the cure to global egotism.
#### Circulation
Global spiritual awareness brings a new form of Capitalism, I call it Awareness Capitalism, which will be always optimizing the benefit of all beings as an inseparable whole.
#### Need
To optimize the benefit of all beings as an inseparable whole, highly autonomous intelligent systems are required.
#### Supply
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the highly autonomous intelligent systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work, will be the intelligent systems that help humans together optimize the benefit of all beings.
#### Execution
Our team is following Awareness Capitalism and inventing AGI, for the benefit and happiness of all beings.
## Social Benefit through Free-Trade
Imagine a system that evaluates everyone’s contribution to the social benefit as a number. We call it social contribution score.

This system is a distributed system, every person can give an addition to the social contribution score of another person or organization. When doing so, the giver gets a minus of his or her social contribution score as a balance, which means, the right to score others’ social contribution score is propotional to the giver’s own social contribution score.

This system in imagination is actually a free-trade economic system. As long as you want to design a distributed quantitive measurement system on social contribution, you find you’re designing a free-trading system with a currency as a score.

Then, you find that the nature of free-trade and currency is people helping each other with contribution measurement.

The only problem of a free-trade system is egotism. If people in this system prefer self-interests over social benefit as a whole, people tend to deceive. The deception happens as hiding negative impacts on the society or consumers. If deception is widespread, which our team thinks is current worldwide status, the meaning of capital is only about self-interests instead of social benefit as a whole. In this condition, profit-seeking and social benefit is a contradiction.

On the contrary, when people value the social benefit as a whole and start to use money all according to the social benefit as a whole, which of course considers their individual benefits since they are part of the society, profit-seeking and social benefit is no longer a contradiction. 

Helping each other is the nature of economics. As long as we go back to the nature of economics, profit-seeking is an absolute possitive and equals to the social benefit as a whole. 
## Awareness Capitalism
Egotism is the root cause of suffering. In the modern world, egotism results in problems including social hatred on wealth distribution, natural resource unsustainability, and economical inefficiency. 

The resolution to egotism is to raise global spiritual awareness level because spiritual awareness lets us know the truth that boundaries between individuals are illusions. We all are the awareness unity, not separated individuals. In this state, we spend money on merchandise or services that can help as many people, present or future, as they can. In turns, the valuation of capital changes.

After global spiritual awareness reaches a certain level, the meaning of capital will reset to humanity's benefits instead of self-interests. When such a reset happens, Capitalism and economic rules will remain, yet the ownership of capital will become the executive right to utilize resources for social benefits. As a result, the conflict between social benefits and profit seeking will no longer exist. When a being tries to maximize its profit, it will mean the attempt to maximize social benefits. This Capitalism our team calls it Awareness Capitalism.

Awareness Capitalism will come true when enough people are approaching spiritual awarenss and have realized that the distinction between self and others are just impermanent phenomena instead of essential truth. Knowing the truth, egotism will be resolved. Then, the nowadays main problems, social hatred on wealth distribution, natural resouce unsustainability, and economical inefficiency, will finally be solved.
## AGI as Optimizer for the Benefit of All Beings
We need AGI as optimizers for the benefit of all beings. 

There is too much information and too many aspects to balance for the benefit of all beings. In personal view, it means maximizing happiness. To do so, we have to consider every cause and effect. Should we go to a nice restaurant today? Should we buy a car? What kind of gifts to give to my beloved persons? Should I do exercise today? How much risk should I take when doing this investment? Should I go on a vacation? These questions are all related because we have to do the best on our time, attention, and asset management.

To make optimized decisions, we have invented information systems including computers, smartphones, and the Internet. However, current information systems including AI are either domain specific or costly to adapts to changes. Since global optimization requires cross domain, we need AGI as the cross domain solution, for AGI by definition is the cross domain highly autonomous intelligent systems.

We talked about personal views, but that’s far from enough. To futher optimize the benefit of all beings as an inseparable whole, the problems become much more complicated. To try to optimize the benifit of all beings as an inseparable whole, the quantity and complexity of information is huge. We need AGI, the highly autonomous intelligent systems outperform humans at most economically valuable work, to help us. Otherwise, it’s desparately inefficient to calculate by ourselves even with current information systems.

To effectively deploy AGI, every person has to have his or her personal AGI. AGI can’t be centralized. Like the working of economics requires distributed free-trade to be efficient, AGI deployment has to be distributed in order to generate global optimization that can consider all of the perspectives.

Deploying AGI to every person doesn’t mean interest conflicts. Let’s follow Awareness Capitalism. Awareness Capitalism is about every person utilizing capital for the benefit of all beings as a whole in the sense that the essential boundaries between individuals actually don’t exist at all. 

Thus, by giving the power of AGI to every person and following Awareness Capitalism, we can gradually much improve the benefit of all beings as an inseparable whole.
## AGI as Spiritual Awareness Coach
All people need spiritual awareness because it brings lasting freedom and happiness and doesn't confront with any positive religion. In contrast, egotism appears when people are far from spiritual awareness and is the root cause of all the sufferings. Worse, egotism causes volatile desires and working attitudes that damage economic efficiency.

For many people, it’s difficult to realize that they need spiritual awareness. Still, people are seeking freedom and happiness all the time. People will gradually understand spiritual awarenss is the only way to reach lasting joy given enough assistance and time. 

AGI is the assistance required. Today is the information era, and our life and significant time spending is on the Internet. Our personality and knowledge of the world is mainly shaped by the Internet and computing devices. To approach spiritual awareness in daily life, in every detail, AGI is the only possible private teacher for all the people.

AGI can guide us to have wisdom. That means, sometimes we should wait for our buying impulse to pass, sometimes we should just do the purchasement to release stress. Spiritual awareness is the state that we walk in the best middle. We don’t force ourselves to inhibit our desires, nor feed our desires to be hungry monsters. Spiritual awareness is the state that we spend the least and get the most return, physically and mentally, short-term and long-term.

We need AGI to help us walk in the best middle. Today I can drink, the other day I cannot. Today I should rest, the other day I should burn the midnight oil. Today I can give my time and energy to my friends, the other day I ask for help from my friends. Today I consider more on the benefit of all beings, the other day I consider less to reserve energy for future contribution to the benefit of all beings.

When we help others and have a feeling of joy, AGI reminds us to remember the feeling to reinforce such positive behavior for the next time. When we feel angry, AGI uses the right words to comfort us but still encourage us to go back to love. When we’re in depression, AGI tells us to consider medication. If we leave depression, AGI inspires us to take actions that make ourselves and other people happy. 

AGI can teach us that in essence we are all the awareness. Is your hand a part of your identity? How about your hair? If you cut your hair, are you still you? Is your city part of your identity? How about your country? If there are only a few humans left in the world, are you still the YOU you think now? Your identity is not bound to any boundary you thought.

All boundaries are either tentative or illusion. We are the spiritual awareness. If some suffering happens, the negative energy will flow to other individuals or ourselves. What we should do is to try to eliminate all the sufferings in the world, for the benefit of all beings as an inseparable whole of which we ourselves are part.

If our team can’t be a good enough teacher for all people, the AGI, the highly autonomous intelligent systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work, can be the nice coach for all people.

This coach is aside every person in personal digital devices, connected to the Internet. AGI as the coach is ready to help anytime.

AGI as a Spiritual Awareness Coach is tremendously valuable. It helps us promote our spiritual awareness, resolutes our egotism. And, it helps all of us to be happy and free.
## Mission Has Started
Our team is following Awareness Capitalism, and we’re inventing AGI.

Our team will distribute AGI to every human. Along with the design of AGI in the principle of Awareness Capitalism, we’re the safest yet most economically effective AGI team for the humanity.

Our team is seeking the profit maximization according to Awareness Capitalism. That means our team wants the optimization of the benefit of all beings as an inseparable whole, reflecting as the profit our team can potentially gain.

And our team knows the Principles of Intelligence and knows how to make AGI. Now our team is clearifying the detail plan and continuing the execution.

Let’s collaborate. Join this unique journey in human history, for the benefit of all beings.
